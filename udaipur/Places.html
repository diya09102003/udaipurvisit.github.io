        <h1>1.Lake Pichola</h1>
        <div class="udaipur">
            <div class="palace">
                <img src="images/pichola.jpg" alt="" width="340rem" height="200rem">
            </div>
            <p class="city">The most famous lake in Udaipur is also its oldest. Lake Pichola is actually an artificial
                lake built in 1362 A.D. Surrounding this lake are a number of pretty restaurants and cafes that let you
                enjoy the lake view.

                Inside Lake Pichola, there are 4 islands, namely, Jag Mandir, Mohan Mandir, Jag Niwas and Arsi Vilas,
                each of which has a beautiful palace resting on it. The luxurious Taj Mahal Palace sits on the Jag Niwas
                Island. These islands can only be reached via boat.</p>
        </div>
        <h1>2.City Palace</h1>
        <div class="udaipur">

            <p class="city">
                Built beside Lake Pichola, the City Palace is a huge palace complex which encompasses some halls,
                galleries and other palaces that are attractions on their own. The entire complex took around 400 years
                to be fully built. The construction was started by the ruling king of Mewar-Maharana Udai Singh II in
                1553. By the time the City Palace was fully built, it saw 22 generations of Sisodia Rajputs.

                Over the years, some of these mini palaces have been converted to luxury hotels and museums. The
                structures in the palace complex are built in Mughal and Rajasthani architectural styles, with the use
                of marble and granite. From many of the rooms and balconies, one can see the Lake Pichola. The terraces
                on the higher floors also offer views of the rest of Udaipur
            </p>

            <p class="city">
                Located on the island of the same name, the Jagmandir Island Palace appears to float on Lake Pichola.
                Also known as Lake Garden Palace, the construction of this building was commissioned by Maharana Amar
                Singh in 1551. The work was finished in the era of his grandson, Maharana Jagat Singh I. The palace is,
                therefore, actually named Jagat Mandir after him.
                Since the palace is in the middle of a lake, it can only be reached via boat. It takes about half an
                hour to reach Jagmandir Island Palace from the jetty at Bansi Ghat. It is open on all days from 10 AM to
                6 PM.
                Most visitors prefer to lunch at the palace restaurant named ‘Darikhana’ which specializes in Rajasthani
                cuisine. This three-storey palace is surrounded by a courtyard and a lovely garden where private parties
                are hosted.

                5 kilometres from Udaipur, Sanjjangarh Palace is a fort on the Bansdara Peak of the Aravalli hills. It served as the monsoon residence of Maharana Sajjan Singh. Built in 1884, its main purpose, apart from housing the king of Mewar, was to let him watch the rain clouds.

The views from up here are absolutely delightful, as you can see most of Udaipur’s lakes and the hilltops of the Aravallis from the terrace courtyard. The fort is 9 storeys tall and built of white marble. There is also a system to harvest rainwater and store it in a cistern underground.

        <h1>8.Bahubali Hills</h1>
        <div class="udaipur">
            <p class="city">The Bahubali Hill situated near the Badi Lake was brought to light by some cheerful young locals of the city, who went on an uncalled exploration expedition near the lake. They then stumbled upon this elevated structure that could be climbed upon by an unstructured pathway.
                Climbing up on the hill, the aerial astounding brief view of the Lake and valley made them spread the word out about this retreat.
                This hill was later named by the youths when the famous movie Bahubali was released, which was based on a brave character named ‘Bahubali’ who couldn’t be defeated but was murdered by deception by his close one.</p>

        <p class="city">
            Located about 2 kilometres from Udaipur, the village of Ahar has over 250 cenotaphs in honour of the maharajas of Mewar. The Ahar Cenotaphs are also known as Mahasatis. In most cases, the remains of the maharajas are elsewhere, but 19 of the maharajas have been cremated here. Special dome-shaped chhatris have been erected to identify them. All of these cenotaphs were constructed throughout a period of 350 years.

            Apart from the cenotaphs, one can also visit the Ahar Archaeological Museum which exhibits antiques which have been discovered through excavations. Interesting items such as terracotta toys, stone weights with animals figures, earthen pottery, seals, metal idols, etc. can be found at the museum.
